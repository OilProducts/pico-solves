# #STONKS


I decided to try something noone else has before. I made a bot to automatically trade stonks for me using AI and machine learning. I wouldn't believe you if you told me it's unsecure!

Spoiler alert: It is.

## Starting from nothing

The challenge provides us with the C code that generated the binary to exploit.  It's not very good.  Since we have source code an easy first step is to run some static analysis on it.  I loaded up the source in CLion which will automatically run clang-tidy.  There are 13 warnings.  Most of them seem harmless but one sticks out

- Format string is not a string literal (potentially insecure)

The relevant code follows: 

`char *user_buf = malloc(300 + 1);
printf("What is your API token?\n");
scanf("%300s", user_buf);
printf("Buying stonks with token:\n");
printf(user_buf);`
