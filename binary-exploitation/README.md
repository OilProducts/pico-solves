#STONKS


I decided to try something noone else has before. I made a bot to automatically trade stonks for me using AI and machine learning. I wouldn't believe you if you told me it's unsecure!

## Starting from nothing

The challenge provides us with C code that generated the binary to exploit.  Its not very good.  Since we have source code an easy first step is to run some static analysis on it.  I loaded up the source in CLion which will automatically run clang-tidy.  There are 13 warnings.  Most of them seem harmless but one sticks out

- Format string is not a string literal (potentially insecure)
